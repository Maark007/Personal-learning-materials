# Facade

Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, framework, or any complex set of classes.

## Applicability

- Use the Facade pattern when you need to have a limited but simple interface for a complex subsystem.

- Use Facade when you want to structure a subsystem in layers.
