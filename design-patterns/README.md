# What is a design pattern?

Design Patterns are general solutions to recurring problems during software development. 
It is not a framework or ready-made code, but a high-level definition of how a common problem can be solved.

### What does the pattern consist of?

- ~~Intent~~ of the pattern briefly describes both the problem and the solution.
- ~~Motivation~~ further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible.
- ~~Structure~~ of classes shows each part of the pattern and how they are related.
- ~~Code example~~ in one of the popular programming languages makes it easier to grasp the idea behind the pattern.
