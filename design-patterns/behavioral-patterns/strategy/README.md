# Strategy

It's a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them in a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.

## Applicability

- Use the Strategy pattern when you want to use different variants of an algorithm within an object and be able to switch from one algorithm to another during execution.
