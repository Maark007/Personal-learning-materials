# Builder

Builder is a creational design pattern that allows you to build complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

## Applicability

- The Builder pattern lets you build objects step by step, using only those steps you really need. After implementing the pattern, you will no longer need to cram dozens of parameters into your constructors.
